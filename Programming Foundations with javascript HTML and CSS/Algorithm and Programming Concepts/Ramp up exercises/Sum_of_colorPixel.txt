'''Write a function named sumPixel that calculates and returns the sum of the red, blue and green values of a pixel.  The function sumPixel has three parameters,  namefile, which is a string that is the name of an image file, and xpos and ypos that are numbers representing the x and y coordinates of the pixel location. Since this function is returning a value, it should NOT have a print statement in the function, and it should have a return statement. Consider the image drewgreen.png.  The pixel at location (250,500) has red component 102, green component 90 and blue component 80. The call  sumPixel("drewgreen.png", 250, 500) should return 102+90+80 = 272. The pixel at location (10,10) has red component 1, green component 255 and blue component 0. The call  sumPixel("drewgreen.png", 10, 10) should return 1 + 255 + 0 = 256.
'''

function sumPixel(namefile, xpos, ypos){
    var someImg = new SimpleImage(namefile);
    redVal = someImg.getRed(xpos,ypos);
    greenVal = someImg.getGreen(xpos,ypos);
    blueVal = someImg.getBlue(xpos,ypos);
    return redVal+greenVal+blueVal;
}
var answer = sumPixel('drewgreen.png',250,500)
print(answer)
