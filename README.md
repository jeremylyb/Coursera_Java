## Goals
This serves as a foundational course for 2 years route map in Software Developer. Together with courses in Unix - Unix and Bash for Beginners Specialization by Codio and SQL - Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization by UCDAVIS, we will use these courses to prepare for FDM Software Development Consultant Programme. 

This by no means suffice as preparation. We will continue to build on what we learn through the course and further develop skillsets

Future courses to look at:
1. Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization by Duke - to further build on OOP 
- Two courses; Object Oriented Programming in Java, Data Structures and Performance

2. ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer - Comprises of other courses to complement the software developer toolkit
- Cloud computing, git, node.js
- Do note that this is python heavy, with primary python frameworks
